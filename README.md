# Android Pay – Payeezy Integration Guide

The document describes how an Android application can use Payeezy to process an Android Pay transaction.

The integration process first step consists of boarding the developer and the merchant into the Payeezy platform, getting the required credentials.

Once boarded, the application can be implemented and tested by sending requests to the Payeezy platforms, using the credentials received in the first step.

# Requirements

- Android version 4.4 (KitKat) or higher
- The Android Pay application installed on the test device
- The latest version of Google Play Services (8.4.xx)

# Obtaining Credentials

The following information is provided when you register on the Payeezy developer Portal:

- API Key – identifies the Developer
- Token – identifies the Merchant
- API Secret – used to compute the HMAC signature

Refer to the [Payeezy Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/payeezy/get_started_with_payeezy/blob/master/get_started_with_payeezy042015.pdf) for instructions how to register with Payeezy and get the information to get you going.

In addition, the Developer should create an encryption key to be used when creating the Android Pay payload. The encryption key created should be specific for Android Pay.

When creating an encryption key, Payeezy provides the following:

- The Public key
- The Public key hash

The public key and the public key hash are provided in the Certs page of the Payeezy developer portal.

Of the five items above, only the public key is required in order to communicate with Android Pay. The other four are used in communicating with Payeezy.

# Application Flow

The typical flow of an application using Android Pay will be as following:

 1. Interacting with the user to get the service or merchandise that the user wishes to purchase.
 2. Create a Masked Wallet request
 3. Displaying the "Pay with Android" button with reference to the Masked Wallet request
 4. Obtaining the Masked Wallet object from Android Pay
 5. Obtaining the Full Wallet object from Android Pay
 6. Using the token retrieved from the Full Wallet object to send the request to the Payeezy server
 7. Process the request results

The following sections describe in more detail how to use the Payeezy credentials to interact with Android Pay and with Payeezy.

Refer to the [Android Pay Developer Site](https://developers.google.com/android-pay/?hl=en) for full documentation and guides for writing an Android Pay application.

## Issuing a Masked Wallet Request

When issuing a Masked Wallet request to Android Pay, the Public Key issued by Payeezy should be provided to Android Pay which uses it to encrypt the transaction details.

To create the MaskedWalletRequest we set the following two parameters:

1. PaymentMethodTokenizationType is set to NETWORK\_TOKEN
2. PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters is set with the Payeezy provided PublicKey

Sample MaskedWalletRequest Code:

```java
      PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters parameters =
           PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters._newBuilder_()
             .setPaymentMethodTokenizationType(
                     PaymentMethodTokenizationType.NETWORK_TOKEN)
             .addParameter( **"** publicKey **"** , Constants.FIRST_DATA_PUBLIC_KEY)
             .build();

      MaskedWalletRequest.Builder builder = MaskedWalletRequest.newBuilder()
            // Other parameters
           .setPaymentMethodTokenizationParameters(parameters)
           .build();
```
## Issuing Full Wallet Request

We get the encrypted payload returned by Android Pay in the Full Wallet response, as a token. The data included in the token should be sent to the Payeezy server in order to process the transaction.

The Full Wallet request uses the Masked Wallet retrieved in the previous step.

```java
      FullWalletRequest fullWalletRequest = FullWalletRequest.newBuilder()
                  .setGoogleTransactionId(googleTransactionId)
                  .setCart(Cart._newBuilder_()
                      .setCurrencyCode(Constants.CURRENCY_CODE_USD)
                      .setTotalPrice(mAmount)
                      .setLineItems(lineItems)
                      .build())
                  .build();

      Wallet.Payments.loadFullWallet(mGoogleApiClient,
                   fullWalletRequest,
                   REQUEST_CODE_RESOLVE_LOAD_FULL_WALLET);
```
Once the Full Wallet is received, the Payment Method Token can be extracted and parsed:

```java
      PaymentMethodToken token = fullWallet.getPaymentMethodToken();
      String tokenJSON = token.getToken();         // Get encrypted token
```
The returned token will be a UTF8 encoded serialized JSON dictionary with the following keys:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| encryptedMessage | String(Base64) | The encrypted message. |
| ephemeralPublicKey | String (base64) | The ephemeral public key associated with thePrivate key used to encrypt the message. |
| tag | String (base64) | MAC of encryptedMessage |

For example:

```java
{
  "encryptedMessage": "ZW5jcnlwdGVkTWVzc2FnZQ==",
  "ephemeralPublicKey": "ZXBoZW1lcmFsUHVibGljS2V5",
  "tag":"c2lnbmF0dXJl"
}
```
## Issuing the Payeezy Request

Once the Full Wallet is received and the token extracted and parsed, the Payeezy request can be created. Note that while the previous steps had to be completed on the mobile device, issuing the Payeezy request can be done from the mobile device or from a server that receives the Full Wallet token.

The request uses a REST POST message with a JSON payload. As mentioned before, the four remaining items issued by Payeezy will be used when issuing the request. The following table describes where the items are used:

| Name | Used in |
| --- | --- |
| API Key | The apikey HTTP header |
| Token | The token HTTP header |
| Public Key Hash | Used in the request payload |
| API Secret | Used to compute the HMAC. The HMAC is added to the request through three HTTP headers. |

## The Payeezy Request

For a full explanation of the Payeezy API please refer to the Payeezy Developer Portal at [https://developer.payeezy.com/payeezy-api/apis/post/transactions](https://developer.payeezy.com/payeezy-api/apis/post/transactions). Following is an example of a Payeezy request payload:

```
{
   "currency_code":"USD",
   "amount":"10000",
   "merchant_ref":"orderid",
   "method":"3DS",
   "transaction_type":"purchase",
   "3DS":{
      "header":{
        "publicKeyHash":"QAjHE+t/4YUVEUpoyZkkuNHJ8eap4= **",**
        "ephemeralPublicKey":"ZXBoZW1lcmFsUHVibGljS2V5",
      },
      "signature":"c2lnbmF0dXJl",
      "type":"G",
      "data":"ZW5jcnlwdGVkTWVzc2FnZQ=="
   }
}
```
The following table describes the contents of the request fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| currency\_code | Code of the currency used in the transaction. For example, USD denotes US Dollars. |
| amount | The transaction amount in cents. For example, 10000 is $100.00. |
| merchant\_ref | The merchant's order number. |
| method | Must be "3DS" |
| transaction\_type | Describes the type of transaction, for example "purchase" |
| publicKeyHash | The public key hash string that was provided by Payeezy. |
| ephemeralPublicKey | The "ephemeralPublicKey" field extracted from the token returned by Android Pay. |
| signature | The "tag" field extracted from the token returned by Android Pay |
| type | Must be "G" |
| data | The "encryptedMessage" field extracted from the token returned by Android Pay |

The request should include the following HTTP headers:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| apikey | The API Key provided by Payeezy |
| token | The token provided by Payeezy |
| content-type | "Application/json" |
| Authorization | Value computed from the Secret and the payload (see the code to compute the HMAC in the Android Pay sample application) |
| nonce | see the code to compute the HMAC in the Android Pay sample application |
| timestamp | see the code to compute the HMAC in the Android Pay sample application |

The response from the Payeezy servers describes the results of the transaction. A sample response:

```
{
      "correlation_id":"227.1448293118225",
      "transaction_status":"approved",
      "validation_status":"success",
      "transaction_type":"purchase",
      "transaction_id":"222078",
      "transaction_tag":"2283767",
      "method":"3ds",
      "amount":"1222",
      "currency":"USD",
      "card":{
         "type":"VISA",
         "cardholder_name":"Not Provided",
         "card_number":"XXXXXXXX",
         "exp_date":"0116"},
      "bank_resp_code":"100",
      "bank_message":"Approved",
      "gateway_resp_code":"00",
      "gateway_message":"Transaction Normal"
}
```
